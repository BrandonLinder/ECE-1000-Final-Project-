This is a very basic automated plant watering system 
This system uses some basic micropyton to program the rasberrypi pico to water a potted plant
this is shown by if the soil is under a certian level of moisture then the water pump activates 
this will water the plant and after a certian amount of moisture is aquired by the plant then it will shut the water pump off 
this is accomplished by a soil sensor and a relay
